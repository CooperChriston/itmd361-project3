    <h1>Favorite Video Games!</h1>
    <p>A list of various video games that I've played throughout the ages along with a general description of the game</p>

    <h2>Favorite Games as a Kid</h2>
    <p>The following games are ones that I really enjoyed playing when I was younger (though I still like playing them now)</p>
    <h3>Castle Crashers</h3>
    <img src="images/castleCrashers.jpg" alt="Castle Crashers Official Cover Art">
    <p>Castle Crashers is a 1-4 player game in which you play (initially) as a knight chasing after the big bad guy to get your king's princesses back. The game gets its name from the fact that you are literally crashing into other castles to steal the princesses back.</p>
    <h3>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</h3>
    <img src="images/mh4u.jpg" alt="Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Official Art">
    <p>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is a 1-4 player game in which you, well, hunt monsters. The title says it all, but doesn't do it much justice. There's a great variety of monsters to take down, from small to the size of a scyscraper.</p>

  <section class="games-section" id="favSeries">
    <h2>Favorite Game Series</h2>
    <p>My favorite series of games is every game in the following series</p>
    <h3>Xenoblade Chronicles</h3>
    <img src="images/xc3.jpg" alt="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Official Cover Art">
    <p>Xenoblade Chronicles is a JRPG series made by Nintendo's development studio Monolithsoft. Each game in the series has a different, yet connected, story that I couldn't possibly dive into here. My main draw to the series is the wonderful world building and settings along with excellent character development. These games are also the only games to have made me cry (I'm a grown man), so that also helped to build an attachment to the series.</p>

    <h2>Games I'm Currently Playing</h2>
    <p>Here are some games that I currently play often</p>
    <h3>Apex Legends</h3>
    <img src="images/apexArt.jpg" alt="Apex Legends Season 20 Official Art">
    <p>Apex Legends is a first person shooter battle royale. You drop into an arena with two teammates and 19 other teams (if you're playing trios), and fight to be the last ones standing. You choose a character to play as, which have unique abilities, typically based on the lore/backstory of the character.</p>
    <h3>Terraria</h3>
    <img src="images/terraria.jpg" alt="Terraria Official Cover Art">
    <p>Terraria is a 2D platorming survival-craft game that you can play by yourself or with friends. This game is like Minecraft's sibling, but it's the better sibling, in my opinion. It's a game that never fails to draw me and my friends back, only to play for an unhealthy amount of time before we beat the game, or check out all the new stuff in an update.</p>
