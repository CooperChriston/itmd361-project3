    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hello to anyone reading this! My name is Cooper Christon, and I'm not the most creative person ever so this page is just an about me page. Here I will talk about some things I like, and show you some dog pictures.</p>

    <h2>Main Hobby</h2>
    <p>My main hobby is playing video games. Single-player, multi-player, I like them all. When it comes to multi-player games, I tend to prefer the competitive side of gaming. 
      I used to be on both the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Apex Legends IIT competitive teams. 
      Unfortunately the Apex team died out due to lack of interest, and people just moving on. As for Smash, I just do not enjoy the game competitively anymore, because it's pretty 
      boring and steals far too much time from your life. I stil play Apex often, and play Smash casually with a bunch a friends every now and then.</p>

    <h2>Doggy Pictures</h2>
    <p>I have multiple dogs, The first two pictures are of my dog named Luna, and she's an Australian shepherd. She's really small for her breed, which leads us to think she's got some other breed(s) in her too, 
      but we got her from Amish people, so we have no idea. The third picture is my dog, Kyla, she's a German shepherd. I have "better" photos of them, but these ones are awesome.</p>
